  "When to use:",
  '- The user explicitly asks for a workflow — "use a workflow", "with a workflow", "使用 workflow", "用工作流", or any phrasing that names workflow/工作流 as the means: this tool is mandatory. Do not substitute the Agent/Task subagent tools, do not do the work inline yourself, and do not judge the task too small for a workflow — the user chose the tool, and that choice is theirs. Size only decides how many subagents the script gets, never whether it is written.',

].join("\n");

const RULES = [
  "Authoring rules:",
  "- Plain TypeScript. Define result types with a plain `interface Foo { ... }` or `type Foo = ...` and pass them as `ask<T>` type arguments.",
  "- Compiled under `strict` (with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` off): indexing an array or record (`items[i]`) needs no guard. `.find()`, `.match()`, `Map.get()` and optional properties still yield `T | undefined` / `null` and must be guarded before use.",
  "- Never use the `declare` modifier (`declare interface`, `declare const`, ...): the script is compiled inside a function body, where ambient declarations are illegal. (The facade block above uses `declare` because it is the host's ambient API description — do not imitate it; your script defines plain interfaces.)",
  "- No `export` statements either — the workflow's output is its final `return`.",
  "- Top-level `await` and a final `return <value>` are allowed; the returned value is exactly what you receive in the completion notification.",
  "- No `import` statements.",
  "- No Node/web APIs: `process`, `fetch`, `fs` do not exist and fail typechecking.",
  "- `world.run` executes a real command. Its first argument must be a compile-time string literal — the script's command set is shown to the user at confirmation — so interpolate runtime values into the args array, never into the command name. A nonzero exit code comes back as a value (`{ exitCode, stdout, stderr }`), not an exception: branch on `exitCode` for gate checks. Default timeout 300s; override per call with `timeoutMs` (no cap). Spawn failures and timeouts reject; stdout/stderr over 256KB each reject like any other over-cap world read.",
  // 门的强度：实盘里脚本几乎都有验证阶段，
  // 但门常比任务弱——仓库有单测与 e2e 两层时只跑单测，然后把 e2e 写进 notCovered。工具描述只
  // 带规则一句，理由与两层门的写法在 skill。
  "- Choose the gate from the repository, not from habit: before writing a `world.run` check, find the checks the project already defines (package.json scripts, a Makefile, CI, the README's verify command) and let the strongest one the request implies decide the exit. A fast unit suite may drive a loop's rounds, but the integration suite, end-to-end suite or bench that actually decides the request runs at least once before the final `return`, with the `timeoutMs` it needs. A check that exists and was skipped is not `notCovered`; it is unverified work, and the report must say so.",
  // 验证与代价成比例 + 只在下一步需要全部结果处 join：实盘里验证按形式叠加、阶段间一律 Promise.all 屏障。各一句，理由在 skill。
  "- Verify in proportion to what a wrong claim costs: findings the user will act on as fact get an independent confirmer or a deciding `world.run`; a `world.run` that already decided needs no confirmer on top; creative or subjective output gets at most one independent read; a suite the script runs as a gate is run once, by the script — say so in the asks so subagents do not each run it again.",
  "- Join with `Promise.all` only where the next step needs every item. When two stages map one to one (a reviewer per file, a confirmer per finding), chain them per item inside the fan-out callback and join once at the end, so confirmation starts as each result lands instead of after the slowest item.",
  "- Test fixed logic (parsers, glob patterns, gate predicates) with the `EvalWorkflowSnippet` tool before submitting: it runs a snippet against the same compiler and world-read path, and a passing snippet pastes into the workflow verbatim.",
  "- The workflow's final `return` is the report the main agent hands back. Return a report shape — a conclusion, findings with their evidence and whether each was confirmed, what was verified and how, what was not covered — rather than a bare array. The dynamic-workflows skill carries the interface to copy.",
  '- Publish what the user should see with `artifact.*`: a file a subagent wrote (`await artifact.file("book", "out/book.pdf", {title, primary: true})`, workspace-relative, copied at publish time, same id again = new version), a markdown you composed, or a dashboard declared once at the top (`artifact.chart("perf", {x, y})`) and fed by `report(item, "perf")`. When a run publishes more than one, mark the deliverable `primary: true` (one id per run) so the card and the run pane lead with it. Ids and the report tag are compile-time literals. Publishing rejects catchably when the file is missing or too large — that is the moment to hand the gap back to a subagent.',
  "- The final `return` stays the model-facing result; artifacts are the user-facing deliverable. Never put the same content in both.",
  "- Model-side errors never reach the script. Rate limits, concurrency limits, overload, network errors, timeouts and unknown provider errors are retried by the runtime without limit while it adapts the fan-out to what the provider accepts; a deterministic one (expired sign-in, model not in the plan, quota cap, invalid request) stops the whole run as `stopped` so the user can fix the cause and resume it — the script is never told. So do not write retry loops or `try`/`catch` for provider errors. Reserve `try`/`catch` and retry loops for logic failures — a subagent result that failed validation, a gate that did not pass, a world read over its cap, an artifact publish whose source file is missing, or a `ContextLimit` (the ask was too large for the model's context even after compaction: split the work or send less).",
  // 与上一条同源：并发是运行时的事，不是模型的调节旋钮。`max_concurrency` 的完整语义在
  // 字段描述上（contracts/tools/create-workflow.ts），这里只放一条交叉引用，免得模型把它
  // 当成 provider 限流的对策——那正是上一条刚说过运行时自己会处理的东西。
  "- How many subagents work at once is the runtime's decision, not the script's. Do not design around it, and set the `max_concurrency` field only when the user asks to limit parallelism — never in response to provider errors.",
  // 与上一条同一族：run 级的旋钮，默认不该被碰。这里唯一要说穿的是「换的是子代理，不是你」

  "- The workflow's subagents run on the session model unless the `subagent_model` field says otherwise. Set it only when the user asks for the subagents to run on a specific model; you (the main agent) stay on the session model either way. ListModels lists what this host has configured.",

That graph is the user\'s entire experience of a workflow — supplying phases is part of writing one.',
  '- Name each phase for the user, in the language the user is speaking in this session: a short natural phrase saying what this stage accomplishes ("Research each changed file in parallel", "汇总并产出最终报告"). Orchestration vocabulary the user never chose — "fan-out", "gate", "aggregate" — is not a phase name; the user approves stages by what they do. Say it the way you would tell a colleague what is happening: "Check that the tests still pass" / "确认测试仍然通过", not "Gate: test verification" / "执行测试验证任务".',
  "- Mechanics: the name must be a compile-time string literal (no interpolation), and the call must be a standalone statement — the marker claims the rest of its enclosing block, nested blocks and inlined helper calls included, so a marker inside an `if` covers that branch only. Two markers with the same name are one phase, which is how a retry loop stays two nodes instead of per-round sprawl.",
  "- Every phase must contain at least one subagent `ask` or one `world.run`. A phase is a stage the user can watch progress through; plain script logic between two asks — reading `args`, shaping a prompt, building the final `return` — runs in a flash and shows no progress, so it is not a stage. Fold that logic into the phase before or after it. Do not open a phase for the setup at the top or the `return` at the bottom.",
