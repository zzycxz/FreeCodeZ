/**
 * Where a strand's exits wait between the `fork` that starts it and the `join` that
 * collects it — the one piece of state the concurrent control-flow graph (flow-graph.ts)
 * keeps outside its recursion over the control tree.
 *
 * A strand region is flowed at its SPAWN point, because that is where the trace records
 * it, but its exits do not belong there: they belong at the barrier that awaits its
 * promise, an arbitrary distance later in the leaf stream and possibly in another region.
 * So a strand parks its exits under its own region id and the spawner carries on
 * unchanged; the `settle` leaf whose `joins` names the region unparks them and merges them
 * into its own outgoing sources. A strand is joined at most once, exactly as the walk's
 * `joined` set says. Whatever is still parked when the root's sequence ends joins the
 * sink: nothing awaited it, so all that is known is that the script did not outlive it.
 *
 * The park also answers `alongside` for a `mark` leaf — which phases are still running
 * when this one is entered — which is why it carries each strand's phases and not only its
 * exits. Like every other projection module it must not import `typescript`; it is a
 * separate file only because flow-graph.ts sits at the 400-line cap.
