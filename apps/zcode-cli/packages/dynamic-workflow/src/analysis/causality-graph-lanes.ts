 * The LAST pass: rewrite a may-set step into one copy per candidate lane.

 * `(cond ? a : b).ask(p)` is the same program as `cond ? a.ask(p) : b.ask(p)`, and the
 * analyzer already draws the second form as one `maybe` step per lane. Drawing the first
 * form as a single card made the picture depend on where the ternary sits, and on a
 * script whose every ask is a may-set it left candidate lanes with no homed step at all —
 * which the mermaid emitter culls, erasing an actor from the workflow.
 *
 * This runs AFTER ordering and reduction by contract: reduction never sees copies, so
 * every reduction rule and its corpus behaviour are unchanged and this stays a mechanical
 * rewrite of the finished graph.
