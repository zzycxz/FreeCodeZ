 * The control-flow projection: "where can

 *
 * Input is the core's trace read as a STRUCTURED CONTROL TREE (flow-tree.ts): regions are
 * the inner nodes, events the leaves in pre-order, and each leaf's `regions` chain names
 * its ancestors. The walk already resolved everything that needed the AST — arm grouping (`choice`), helper
 * boundaries (`call`), try parts, and every `jump`'s target region — so this module is a
 * pure function of the core and must not import `typescript`.
 *
 * Nodes are OCCURRENCES (each `issue` leaf, each `mark` leaf), not sites: a helper called
 * twice contributes two nodes for one step id. The phase quotient (`phaseEdges`) folds
 * them back by phase. Neither level is transitively reduced — a CFG never is.
 *
 * The graph is CONCURRENT: a `strand` region (an asynchronous activation the walk inlined)
 * is entered by a `fork` and left by a `join` at the barrier that awaits its promise, not
 * at its spawn point. Its exits wait in the strand park (flow-strands.ts) in between, and a
 * `mark` reached while strands are parked records their phases as `alongside` — a node
 * fact, because "an earlier phase is still running here" is not a transfer of control and
 * cannot be read off the edges once they fold.

   *  - a body that meets no node of its own can still have real exits. The `.finally` of
   *    `async-promise-then-both-callbacks` holds no call, but its barrier joins the two
   *    `.then` strands and their exits surface in `bodyExits`. `entries` is built from
   *    the edges leaving the entry PLACEHOLDER, which never reached a node here, so the
   *    entries test drops them and leaves two ask nodes with no outgoing edge at all.
   *  - a body full of nodes can still carry an exit that met none. A `return` whose path
   *    touched nothing stands on whatever `withEntries` rewrote the placeholder to; on
   *    `functions-summaries-mutual-recursion` that is an enclosing body's placeholder,
   *    and parking it emitted `$entry1 -> sink`, an edge out of a node that never was.
