/**
 * THE TEMPORAL INVARIANT: a promise cannot settle before its request issues. The oracle

 * step that has not been issued at this point in evaluation order, and settling it here
 * would be a temporally impossible event. Returns HOW the witness was admitted, because
 * the two ways carry different certainty (see {@link claimAt}).
 *
 * Bug this fixes: in async-promise-double-await-mutate, `first.steps.push(extra)` merges
 * ask#2's label into the very slot `plan` denotes, so the EARLIER `await plan` read
 * {ask#1, ask#2}. That phantom settle of ask#2 both cost the await its singleton-exact
 * certainty and emitted `ask#2 -> ask#3 seq maybe`, which dedupeFacts' min-certainty
 * merge then used to demote a true `data always` edge.
 *
 * The `repetition` carve-out is not optional. A step issued LATER IN THE WALK but sharing
 * an enclosing iteration construct with the await is realizable by REPETITION: iteration
 * k's promise settles at iteration k+1's await, which is exactly the loop-carried settle
 * the oracle exists to find (reduce-accumulator awaits the accumulator, i.e. the previous
 * round's ask, before issuing this round's). A bare `issued.has(step)` test drops it, the
 * barrier falls through to a widening that finds nothing pending inside the region, and
 * the step loses its `serial` cue for a `stack` that claims N concurrent instances the
 * script serializes — trading a model-only certainty bit for a wrong cue that is DRAWN.
 * This mirrors `realizableCarry` in causality-graph.ts, which decides backwards edges by
 * the same "a shared iteration region is what repetition can realize" rule.

 * surviving set be a singleton and settle certainly. Judging first and filtering after
 * would leave the phantom's vote counted.
 *
 * A witness admitted by REPETITION never settles certainly, even as a singleton exact
 * one, because the ordering it would claim fails at BOTH ends of the loop: the first
 * iteration awaits the initial value and settles nothing, and the last iteration's issue
 * escapes the loop unawaited (the head await of iteration k+1 never runs), so that
 * instance is still pending afterwards. A certain claim there would assert a post-loop
 * ordering the final instance violates — over-ordering as a may-claim is the licensed
 * direction, over-CERTAINTY on a real edge is not. `order-loop-head-await-tail-issue`
 * pins it. The demotion costs the multiplicity cue nothing: `settledInside` records the
 * step whatever the event's certainty, so a `serial` cue survives it.

/**
 * An `await` barrier over the union of what the two halves resolved, plus the summaries of
 * the STRANDS it joins: `certain` settles as a certainty, `maybe` as a may-claim (a step
 * claimed by both counts as certain). Steps already settled IN A VISIBLE FRAME drop out,
 * and a claim that has entirely settled already is a no-op. Widening is reached only when
 * the claim and every joined summary were empty to begin with.
 *
 * The already-settled no-op is not new; what changed is that it became REACHABLE. Before
 * the settle oracle, an indirect await (`await held`, `await p` in a helper, a second await of
 * one promise) resolved to the empty set, so every such await fell through to widening and
 * manufactured `seq maybe` claims over unrelated steps still in flight. The oracle makes
 * the claim non-empty, so the no-op catches it and those spurious barriers disappear —
 * which is why several async-promise-* snapshots got STRONGER certainties once the oracle
 * landed rather than gaining edges.
 *
 * Two frame rules carry the strand model:
 * freshness is judged against EVERY frame on the stack, because a step the spawner
 * already awaited is settled for the strands it spawns; fresh steps are recorded in the
 * CURRENT frame alone, because this activation's await tells the spawner nothing.
 * `awaited` is the operand this barrier stands over, which {@link joinStrands} scans for
 * the promises it names; a barrier with no operand (a deferred callback's receiver
 * prologue) can still LIFT a strand out of its own claim.
