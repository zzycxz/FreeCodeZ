 * Publish what the user should see: the run's own deliverable surface, kept after it ends.
 * Two habits. (1) EVERY RUN PUBLISHES ITS DELIVERABLE, whatever the user asked for: a webpage
 * or PDF a subagent wrote goes out via file(); an answer (findings, a review) goes out as the
 * long form of the facts the return summarises, usually via markdown(). Once, at the end;
 * skip it only when the whole answer is one line. When the run publishes more than one
 * artifact, mark the deliverable { primary: true }. (2) A DASHBOARD IS FOR THE PERSON WATCHING
 * THE RUN: declare one when there is state worth watching mid-run (the key number per round,
 * which items are done) and none when the run is over before anyone looks. Two tests keep it
 * to what matters: would the user open it on its own? does it repeat another artifact? A CSV
 * and a table of its rows: one of them is noise.
 *
 * Every id is a compile-time string literal (non-empty, at most 64 characters of
 * [A-Za-z0-9_.-]); the set a run can publish is fixed at submit time, so the compiler
 * rejects a computed one. Within one run an id belongs to exactly one member.
 * The two families are deliberately asymmetric, and the asymmetry is the whole design:
 * - CONTENT (file, markdown) are EFFECTS: async, resolve to an ArtifactRef, and REJECT
 *   catchably — missing file, not a file, path outside the workspace, over the size cap, no
 *   store. try { await artifact.file("book", "out/book.pdf") } catch { …ask a subagent to
 *   write it… } is the intended idiom. Bytes are copied at publish time, so later workspace
 *   edits never rewrite a version; republishing an id mints the NEXT version and keeps the
 *   old ones (at most 16 per id).
 * - PRESET (chart, table, metrics, board) are DECLARATIONS: synchronous, return nothing,
 *   never touch a file; they say how items tagged with their id are drawn. Declare each ONCE,
 *   at the top, then feed it with report(item, "<id>"). The same id with an identical spec is
 *   a no-op; a DIFFERENT or malformed spec fails the whole run — a void return has no
 *   rejection channel, exactly as with report().
 * Caps: 32 ids per run, 16 versions per id, 20 MiB per file, 256 KB per markdown, 120
 * characters of title and 500 of description.

 * Required in every script you submit, not optional: the phase graph is how the user
 * experiences the workflow. Without markers they face one card per step and no story;
 * group the whole script, top to bottom.
 *
 * Name phases for the user, in the language the user is speaking in this session: a short
 * natural phrase saying what the stage accomplishes ("Research each changed file in parallel",
 * "汇总并产出最终报告"). Graph-building vocabulary the user never chose — "fan-out", "gate",
 * "aggregate" — is not a name; the user approves stages by what they do. Say it the way you
 * would tell a colleague what is happening: "确认测试仍然通过", not "执行测试验证任务".
 *
 * The scope is the rest of the enclosing block: the marker claims every step issued
 * from it to the end of the block it stands in — nested blocks and inlined helper
 * calls included — and the enclosing phase resumes once that block ends. A marker
 * inside an if-branch therefore groups that branch and does not leak past it. Two
 * markers with the same name are one phase: repeating a name continues that phase,
 * which is the opposite of an actor's name — that one has to be unique.
 *
 * Two rules the compiler enforces. The name must be a compile-time string literal
 * ("review the diff" or a no-substitution template) and non-empty, because the phase
 * names label the graph the user confirms before anything runs. And the call must
 * stand alone as its own statement: a marker in expression position has no
 * rest-of-block to claim.
 *
 * Every phase must contain at least one subagent ask or one world.run. A phase is a
 * stage the user watches progress through; plain script logic between two asks (reading
 * args, shaping a prompt, building the return) runs in a flash and shows no progress, so
 * it is not a stage. Fold it into the phase before or after it; never open a phase for
 * the setup at the top or the return at the bottom.
 *
 * Idiom: one marker at the head of each stage that does work — name the loop body and
 * its check where they start, name the close-out that asks or runs after the loop.
