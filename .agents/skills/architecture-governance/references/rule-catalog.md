| `module-dependency`        | Cross-module import is missing from `requires`                                  | Add a public contract or move the integration owner               |
| `deep-import`              | Import bypasses a module public entrypoint                                      | Import the contract/index entrypoint                              |
| `cycle`                    | The managed dependency graph contains a cycle                                   | Split the owner or invert the dependency through a port           |
| `max-file-lines`           | Managed source exceeds the policy budget                                        | Split by responsibility; do not add a disable                     |
| `max-contract-lines`       | A contract is too broad                                                         | Split the capability or reduce the public surface                 |
| `max-public-methods`       | A contract exposes too many methods                                             | Split the capability or introduce a narrower read/write contract  |
| `layer-direction`          | A layer imports a higher implementation layer                                   | Depend on a lower layer port or move the integration owner        |
| `domain-io`                | Domain code imports process, network, filesystem, or timer APIs                 | Move IO to an adapter and pass a typed port into the domain       |
| `ui-implementation-import` | A file in a `ui` layer imports a repository, runtime, or service implementation | Depend on the module port / read model exposed by `contract.ts`   |
| `expired-exception`        | A configured exception has expired                                              | Resolve the violation and remove the expired exception            |
| `missing-module-artifact`  | A managed module lacks its manifest or contract fixtures                        | Add the required module contract, example, test, and CONTRACT.md  |
| `disable-count`            | Managed code adds a lint suppression                                            | Fix the underlying violation or add a reviewed expiring exception |

Existing violations are suppressible only through `.architecture-baseline.json`; new violations remain blocking.

The current resolver follows relative imports among discovered source files. Workspace package names, path aliases and dynamic imports need separate inspection. `--changed` selects working-tree differences from `HEAD` and untracked files; use a full check when reviewing committed changes.
